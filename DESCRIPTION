Description: A Shiny-based application for interacting with the main single-cell data 
	embeddings - UMAP, tSNE, PCA - both in 2D and 3D, as well as performing different 
	types of analysis of said data, such as finding cell type markers or determining 
	the differential genes between two different conditions.
